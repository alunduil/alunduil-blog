title: About
---

I love exploring different approaches to development with new and bleeding-edge 
technologies. A passion for purely functional programming has led me to use and 
promote [Haskell] and [NixOS] whenever possible.

Most of my projects are publicly available on [Github] and more are being
released to [Hackage] as I complete them.  I've programmed in a variety of
languages: [Haskell], [Go], [Python], [Ruby], C++, Fortran, and more I'm not
remembering.  Other projects I contribute to include: [Gentoo], [NixOS], and
[Libraries.io].

Currently, I work on developing cloud native applications in [Haskell]
(leisure) and [Go] \(professional).  I also perform continuous deployments of
applications using [Travis], [Google Cloud Platform] \(including
[Google Cloud Container Builder]), [Heroku] and other technologies.

Previously, I architected and developed a set of services (written in [Python])
geared towards simplifying the container deployment experience.  Along with
development I also created and delivered training focused on [Cloud][unlocked],
[Python], [Ruby], and [Chef].

When I'm not working on Technology, I make hobbies of reading, video games, 
tabletop games (e.g. [Earthdawn]), and playing bass guitar.

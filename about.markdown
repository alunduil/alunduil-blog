title: About
---

I love exploring new approaches to development with new and bleeding-edge
technologies.  I have a passion for purely functional programming and promote
[Haskell] and [NixOS] at every opportunity.

Previously, I focused on training employeers in [Cloud][unlocked], [Python],
[Ruby], and [Chef].

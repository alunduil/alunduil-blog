Alex has been employed by Rackspace since 2010.  Currently, he is a technical
trainer working with cloud technologies, software development, and Linux.  He
is attempting to complete the `Gentoo Developer Quizzes
<http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/devrel/quiz/>`_ and become a Gentoo Developer.

Alex also enjoys music and plays several instruments including the bass,
saxaphone and piano.  With a background in physics, Alex considers the larger
research sphere when solving simple problems and uses this different
perspective to critically analyze the status quo.

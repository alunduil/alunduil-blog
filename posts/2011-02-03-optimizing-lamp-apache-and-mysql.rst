Introduction
------------

Faster and faster â€¦ optimization always comes up when discussing web
applications and serving techniques.  We'll be covering optimization of `MySQL
<http://www.mysql.com/>`_ as well as how to tune the `Apache
<http://httpd.apache.org/>`_ MPM (multi-processing module).

Quick Wins
----------

There are a few applications that require little to no configuration that can
be installed or enabled to improve performance in a PHP environment:

* `APC <posts/using-apc-to-speed-up-php.html>`_
* `Memcached <posts/using-memcached-with-mediawiki-and-wordpress.html>`_

Optimizing MySQL
----------------

`Major Hayden (a.k.a. Racker Hacker) <http://rackerhacker.com/>`_ wrote an
excellent utility for profiling MySQL called `mysqltuner.pl
<https://raw.github.com/rackerhacker/MySQLTuner-perl/master/mysqltuner.pl>`_.
This utility summarizes the common analytics that MySQL captures and presents
them with recommendations for optimizations.  The recommendations should
generally be ignored as they're for a specific work type but the nice report
of information (shown below) can be used as a quick guide for tuning MySQL.
Running this script is extermely easy: `wget -O - mysqltuner.pl | perl`.  If
you do not have a `~/.my.cnf` file with your credentials the script will prompt
you for them so it can collect the information it needs.

    -------- Recommendations -----------------------------------------------------
    General recommendations:
        Run OPTIMIZE TABLE to defragment tables for better performance
        Temporary table size is already large - reduce result set size
        Reduce your SELECT DISTINCT queries without LIMIT clauses
        Increase table_cache gradually to avoid file descriptor limits
    Variables to adjust:
        table_cache (> 2048)

.. note::

  The longer MySQL is running the more data you have to work with when doing
  analysis like this.  By only getting information from a one hour uptime you
  may be missing out on trends over a day or days.

Understanding how these parameters affect memory and runtime are going to be
the best way to optimize MySQL for your particular workload.  Blindly
following the recommendations provided can make your MySQL instance run worse
rather than better.

With that in mind, the next section is a small glossary of parameters that
have the most noticeable impact on MySQL's performance.  As always your
mileage may vary and the `MySQL manual
<http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/index.html>`_ s are an excellent
resource as well.

Glossary of mysqltuner Categories and Controlling Parameters
============================================================

:Maximum possible memory: Not actually a hard limit on the memory usage but
                          the calculated maximum memory usage based on per
                          thread allocations and number of threads allowed; a
                          good check to ensure you're not overallocating memory
                          with other MySQL parameters
:Highest usage of available connections: The maximum number of concurrent
                                         connections seen since MySQL was
                                         started; may indicate a spike during
                                         the runtime of MySQL and not a
                                         sustained connection set
:Query cache efficiency: Query cache hit rate; ideally all queries would come
                         from the query cache but some workloads want this
                         disabled completely (i.e. extremely dynamic queries
                         where there are very few identical queries happening
                         back to back)
:Temporary tables created on disk: Indicates the number of temporary tables
                                   (from joins and other temporary table
                                   creating queries) that were created on the
                                   disk rather than in memory; this is the
                                   first place to trim if memory usage is too
                                   high but also a good place to allocate
                                   those gobs of extra memory on the system
:Thread cache hit rate: Number of threads (connections) that were re-used
                        rather than torn down and re-created
:Table cache hit rate: Number of table file descriptors that were re-used
                       rather than re-opened.

Optimizing Apache
-----------------

Common Apache tunables are in httpd.conf unless your distribution organizes
its Apache configuration into multiple, easier to read files.  Gentoo stores
the tunables we'll be covering in `/etc/apache2/modules.d/00_mpm.conf`.

Apache allows you to change the multi-processing strategy through modules.
The common MPMs are prefork (the default), worker, peruser, and event.
Determining which MPM you are currently using is done by issuing
`/usr/sbin/apache2 -l`.  Most binary distributions don't even offer the last
two as options for their builds of Apache.

    # Server-Pool Management (MPM specific)

    # PidFile: The file in which the server should record its process
    # identification number when it starts.
    #
    # DO NOT CHANGE UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING
    PidFile /var/run/apache2.pid

    # The accept serialization lock file MUST BE STORED ON A LOCAL DISK.
    #LockFile /var/run/apache2.lock

    # Only one of the below sections will be relevant on your

Glossary of MPM Parameters
==========================

The important parameters to tweak when playing with Apache memory and
performance are the following:

:StartServers: Number of servers to start running and handling connections when
               Apache is started
:MinSpareServers: Minimum number of servers to have running and not handling
                  connections
:MaxSpareServers: Maximum number of servers to have running and not handling
                  connections
:MaxClients: Maximum number of clients that can simultaneously connect to
             Apache
:MaxRequestsPerChild: Maximum number of requests that a child will respond to
                      before terminating

Conclusion
----------

Optimizing Apache and MySQL can be done in a multitude of ways with an even
larger number of tunable parameters.  As always, after making changes test to
verify that they do improve performance for your workload.  This should
provide a start when optimizing a LAMP setup.

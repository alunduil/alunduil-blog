Recently, I've found the wonderful android application, `Profile Valet
<http://www.appbrain.com/app/profile-valet/com.pushpin.profile>`_.  This
little application handles location and time based profiles for various
settings on your Android device.  It can control things like sound, wifi, and
bluetooth based on time schedules or locations (GPS backed).  Using a utility
like this can help prevent the common, "I forgot to unsilence my phone,"
situation; resulting in missed calls, texts, or emails.  It can also be used
to control silencing your phone for certain events.  Simply setup a profile
for various movie theaters to silence your phone automatically when you enter
that area.

By automating the little things in life we can open up our minds with less
stress and turn our attention to more fun or important matters.  I know this
concept has been introduced by the `**Getting Things Done**
<http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0142000280/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1298391597&amp;sr=8-1>`_
paradigm but it can be expanded in the digital age of smartphones even further
than simply organizing one's life.  It can be expanded to allow our devices to
be the tool they were designed to be.

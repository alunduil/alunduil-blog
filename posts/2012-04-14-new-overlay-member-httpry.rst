I've spent a few moments and added a live ebuild of httpry (an HTTP traffic
analyzer) to `my overlay </posts/alunduil-overlay.html>`_.  This utility prints
out HTTP requests in real time coming through the server in the same format one
would get from `apache2 fullstatus`.  The homepage for this project is
`http://dumpsterventures.com/jason/httpry <http://dumpsterventures.com/jason/httpry/>`_
and a stable package can be expected in the overlay quite soon.
